# placement-portal
Welcome to the Placement Portal project! This platform is designed to streamline and simplify the process of connecting students with potential employers for job placements and internships.


About the Project:
The Placement Portal is a centralized hub where students can create profiles showcasing their skills, education, and work experiences. On the other hand, recruiters and companies can register and post job opportunities, internships, or campus placement drives. The portal aims to bridge the gap between talented students and companies searching for the right candidates.
It also contains a "Placement Feed" where students can share their experiences about their journey and how they got into a particular company.

It is built using React Js, Firebase, and Chakra UI.
